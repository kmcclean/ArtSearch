The goal of this is to create a project that uses Django to host a search vehicle that finds individual pieces of art
from art museums and galleries in the Twin Cities. The search engine will display the results, along with any image available
for that particular piece.

At the moment, the front end is not set up. Currently the system returns the name of the pieces, as well as the number
from each artist and the museums where they might be found. In order to access this, please run "ArtSearchMain.py" in the
ArtSearch/src folder.
